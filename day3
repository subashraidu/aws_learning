# EC2

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a core AWS service that lets you run virtual servers (called instances) in the cloud.
It provides resizable compute capacity, meaning you can choose how much CPU, memory, and storage you need—and only pay for what you use.

What Can You Do with EC2?
Host websites and web applications
Run backend services or APIs
Deploy databases or containers
Set up custom environments (Linux, Windows, etc.)
Build test/staging servers for DevOps

EC2 Features:
Scalable – Add or remove instances on demand
Flexible – Choose OS, storage, networking, and software
Secure – Use IAM roles, security groups, and VPCs
Cost-Effective – Pay only for what you use (On-Demand, Spot, Reserved)

Key Components:
Instance	A virtual machine (like a server) running in EC2
AMI (Amazon Machine Image)	A pre-configured template used to launch an EC2 instance (includes OS + software)
Instance Type	Specifies the hardware of the instance (e.g., t2.micro, m5.large)
EBS (Elastic Block Store)	Storage volume attached to EC2 instances
Security Group	Acts like a virtual firewall to control traffic to/from your instance
Key Pair	SSH credentials used to securely connect to Linux instances

# types of EC2 instances

Amazon EC2 offers different instance types designed for various use cases. Each instance type is optimized for specific workloads like compute, memory, storage, or networking.

EC2 Instance Families (Main Categories):
General Purpose	-- Balanced CPU, memory, and networking	-- Web servers, dev/test, small databases
Compute Optimized	-- High-performance CPU	-- High-performance web servers, batch processing
Memory Optimized	-- More RAM than CPU	-- In-memory databases, big data, caching
Storage Optimized	-- High IOPS and throughput	-- NoSQL DBs, data warehouses, analytics
Accelerated Computing	-- GPU/FPGA for heavy compute	-- Machine learning, HPC, video rendering

 Choosing the Right Instance
Requirement	Recommended Family
General web app	t3, m5
CPU-intensive tasks	c5, c6g
RAM-heavy workloads	r5, x1
High-speed storage	i3, d3
Machine learning	p3, g5

# What is Compute 
Compute refers to the processing power required to run applications, services, and systems. In simple terms, it's the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and memory (RAM) resources that allow software to perform tasks—like executing code, running databases, or handling user requests.

Examples of Compute Services:
Cloud Provider	-- Compute Service	-- Description
AWS	-- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)	-- Run virtual servers
Azure	-- Virtual Machines (VMs)	-- Cloud-hosted Windows/Linux servers
Google -- Cloud	Compute Engine	-- Scalable VMs on demand

# CPU vs RAM – Key Differences

Feature	------ CPU	----------- RAM
Role	---------Executes instructions	-------Stores data temporarily for quick access
Think of as	--------- The brain	-------The short-term memory
Speed Affects	-------- How fast tasks are processed	-----------How many tasks you can handle at once
Data Stored	----------- None (just processes)	------------- Yes (active data and instructions)
Permanent?	---------- No – doesn’t store data	--------- No – data is lost when powered off
Cloud Example	-------- 2 vCPUs in an EC2 instance	-------- 8 GB RAM in the same EC2 instance

Real-World Analogy:
CPU is like the chef in a kitchen—he does the actual cooking (processing).
RAM is like the counter space—it holds the ingredients and tools the chef needs immediately.

CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. It's the brain of a computer or server. It performs all the calculations, logic, and decision-making tasks.
 CPU is used for:
Running applications and programs
Performing calculations (math, logic)
Controlling how other parts of the system work
In cloud (like AWS EC2), you can choose how many vCPUs (virtual CPUs) your instance gets—more CPUs = faster processing.


RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It's the computer's short-term memory. It temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU needs right now or very soon.
 RAM is used for:
Storing active programs and files
Speeding up system performance by avoiding repeated disk reads
Allowing multitasking (running many apps at once)
In cloud instances, more RAM allows you to run heavier workloads like large databases, in-memory caching, etc.
