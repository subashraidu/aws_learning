### VPC


A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It allows you to launch AWS resources (like EC2, RDS, etc.) in a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud. You control IP ranges, subnets, route tables, gateways, and network access rules.

Pros of VPC:
Isolation: Full control over your virtual network.
Security: Fine-grained control via Security Groups and Network ACLs.
Custom Networking: Choose IP ranges, create public/private subnets.
Scalability: Easily scale network infrastructure.
Hybrid Connectivity: Connect on-premises infrastructure via VPN or Direct Connect.

Cons of VPC:
Complexity: Requires understanding of networking concepts.
Misconfiguration Risks: Improper rules or route tables can cause outages or expose resources.
Cost: Some components (e.g., NAT Gateway, VPN) incur additional charges.

Uses of VPC:
Hosting public-facing web apps.
Running backend services in private subnets.
Setting up hybrid cloud networks.
Isolating environments (dev, test, prod).
Hosting secure data stores (e.g., RDS in private subnet).

Importance of VPC:
Essential for security and network control.
Acts as the foundation for most AWS deployments.
Enables multi-tier architecture (web, app, DB layers).
Helps meet compliance and regulatory requirements.

Components of a VPC and Their Uses:
VPC	-------------------------> The isolated network where all AWS resources are launched.
Subnets	---------------------> Divide the VPC's IP range into smaller networks; can be public or private.
Route Tables ----------------> Define how traffic flows within the VPC and to the internet.
Internet Gateway (IGW)	-----> Allows resources in public subnets to access the internet.
NAT Gateway / Instance ------> Enables private subnets to access the internet (e.g., for updates) securely.
Elastic IPs -----------------> Static public IP addresses used with NAT Gateways, EC2, etc.
Security Groups	-------------> Stateful firewalls attached to resources, control inbound/outbound traffic.
Network ACLs	---------------> Stateless firewalls at subnet level for additional traffic control.
DHCP Options Sets	-----------> Customize DHCP options like DNS server, domain name for VPC resources.
VPC Peering -----------------> Connects two VPCs privately over AWSâ€™s network.
Transit Gateway	-------------> Central hub for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.
VPN Gateway -----------------> Enables site-to-site VPN connection to your on-premises network.
VPC Endpoints ---------------> Privately connect your VPC to AWS services without an internet gateway.
Flow Logs -------------------> Capture network traffic logs for analysis and troubleshooting.
Carrier Gateway -------------> For connecting to AWS Wavelength (used in mobile edge computing).
